    excerpt: 'Think building an app takes months? Think again. We used a revolutionary AI-powered workflow to go from idea to functional prototype in just 60 minutes.',
    content: [
      'The barrier to entry for software development has traditionally been high, requiring deep knowledge of programming languages and frameworks. AI is changing that paradigm. We put this to the test with a simple challenge: could we build a functional mobile app for a local coffee shop in one hour using only AI tools?',
      'The secret weapon was a combination of ChatGPT-4 for logic and code generation, and a visual AI builder for the UI. We started by feeding the AI a simple prompt: `Design a user interface for a coffee shop app. It needs a home screen with specials, a full menu page, and a simple order form. The branding should be modern and minimalist.`',
      'Within minutes, we had a full UI design. Next, we moved to the logic. `Generate React Native components for the screens designed. The menu should be populated from a simple JSON object. The order form should take the user\'s name and selected items and log them to the console.`',
      'The AI generated the code with remarkable accuracy. After some minor tweaking and connecting the components, we had a working prototype. While it\'s not a production-ready app, the speed at which we created a tangible, functional product was nothing short of astonishing. This workflow represents the future of rapid prototyping and development.'
