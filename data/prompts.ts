A large DSLR camera with an extremely long telephoto lens hangs from his neck. He is carrying a big cloth bundle labeled in Indonesian text “kumpulan” and “Prompt.” His body language looks sneaky, like a thief who has just stolen something.
Background: a striking black-and-white architectural photograph of a brutalist concrete building, featuring strong geometric lines and dramatic chiaroscuro shadows. The sky is stark and clear. Shot with a tilt-shift lens for perfectly straight perspective. High contrast, fine art photography style.`,

    prompt: `Photographic illusion perspective, side view portrait. A man (attach image) with wet hair still covered in leftover shampoo foam, wearing a white singlet and pink leggings, holding a DSLR camera with a long telephoto lens. He wears only one shoe. The man leans casually against an elegant Italian marble wall — one bare leg bent with his foot pressing naturally against the wall, as if gravity has rotated 90 degrees. 

Above his head, a cheap Indonesian plastic chair sticks to the marble wall. Beside his face sticks a jumbo glass of iced tea (es teh jumbo), and slightly below it, a single shoe also sticks to the wall — all appearing perfectly natural as if the wall were the ground, as if gravity has rotated 90 degrees. 

The marble wall and floor share the same elegant Italian marble pattern, seamlessly connected to enhance the illusion. The background shows a blurred modern foyer with cinematic lighting. 

Style: hyperrealistic photography, 85mm lens, f/1.4 bokeh, shallow depth of field, surreal photographic illusion, comedic aesthetic.`,

    prompt: `Hypermaximalism, an impossible planet composed of towering brutalist skyscrapers interlocked with intricate zodiac iconography. Each building surface is carved with hyper-detailed zodiac reliefs, metallic engravings, and recursive geometric seams that spiral across the architecture like sacred constellations. The skyline bends in impossible geometry — colossal towers curving inward, bridges suspended upside-down, and DSLR cameras with massive telephoto lenses seamlessly built into the structures, functioning as monumental observatories. The materials blend raw concrete, polished steel, and liquid glass reflecting cosmic light and golden haze. Between these surreal towers, a man (attach image) peeks out naturally from behind a wall — only his wet face and one hand visible, hair damp with traces of white shampoo foam. He wears a white singlet and pink leggings, though only hinted by subtle reflections. His gaze is curious yet calm, as if observing from another dimension. The atmosphere glows with ambient living light and reflective mist, creating a sense of cosmic scale and intimate humanity within the impossible brutalist planet.`,

    prompt: `Hypermaximalism, an impossible planet covered with monumental brutalist towers interlocked with intricate zodiac iconography. The architecture bends and spirals in impossible geometry — colossal towers, floating bridges, and telescopic observatories built from raw concrete and metallic zodiac engravings. In the cosmic sky above this impossible planet, a man (attach image) flies gracefully on a giant origami bird made of paper patterned with interlocking zodiac symbols. The origami bird glows softly, its folded wings reflecting cosmic light and liquid chrome hues. The man has wet hair with traces of white shampoo foam, wearing a white singlet and pink leggings. He holds a large DSLR camera with an extremely long telephoto lens, aiming downward as if photographing the surreal city below. The sky is illuminated with glowing zodiac constellations, forming subtle and intricate star patterns that echo the icons on the buildings and origami bird. The angle is cinematic and dramatic — low angle, capturing both the vast brutalist landscape and the soaring figure in mid-flight, backlit by iridescent starlight. The lighting is surreal, with cosmic reflections, golden mist, and shimmering particles that give the entire scene a dreamlike atmosphere of divine absurdity and wonder.`,

    prompt: `A dimly lit, damp underground room with a wet, puddled floor. In the center stands a man with wet hair still covered in leftover shampoo foam. He wears a white sleeveless singlet and tight pink leggings. Around his waist is coiled a lasso rope, and slung across his body hangs a DSLR camera with an extremely long telephoto lens. He is intently observing an uneven wall featuring a dramatic “GRAFITI SCULPTURE RELIEF WALL.”

The relief forms a surreal montage inspired by “Indiana Jones: The Temple of Doom,” and includes the iconic main character of Indiana Jones carved into the relief itself, complete with his signature fedora hat, rugged leather jacket, whip at his side, and satchel. Surrounding him within the relief are other unusual objects also sculpted into the wall: cheap Indonesian plastic chairs (kursi plastik murahan), a charcoal iron (setrika arang), an oversized iced tea in a jumbo plastic cup (esteh jumbo), a lacy bra (kutang berenda), a small green gas canister (tabung gas melon), and mysterious geometric markings reminiscent of secret society symbols.

    prompt: `A hyper-detailed maximalist horror scene, glossy and psychedelic, rendered in hypervoronoi and lattice reality style.

The central figure is a recursive chain of screaming faces: one hyper-realistic human face frozen in terror, mouth wide open, and inside the mouth another screaming face, repeating endlessly like a spiral vortex of agony. Each face is slick and glossy, drenched in sweat, oil, or tears. The recursion spirals inward, each layer more distorted, reflective, and surreal.

The screaming faces fragment into glowing voronoi cells, their skin splitting into thousands of polygonal shards reflecting neon colors. Lattice grids stretch between faces, glowing like shattered glass webs. Neon liquid flows through the lattice veins, dripping into voronoi cracks.

Background surfaces ripple into infinite hypervoronoi tessellations, each cell filled with fragments of distorted eyes, mouths, and reflections. Neon liquid and shards spiral downward toward the vortex center, creating a hypnotic, chaotic flow.

Camera Angle: Top-down view, looking directly at the recursive faces from above. Faces, lattice grids, and voronoi shards form a spiral vortex descending into infinite recursion. Neon reflections and glossy textures exaggerate depth, chaos, and psychedelic overload.`,
